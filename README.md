# SoapClientExample
- - -
This application is a "Hello World" example for creating a Apache Axis Soap Client.
Assumes you have a "Tomcat" style web server running on localhost.

The procedure for creating 
this application in IntelliJ is:
1) Create a new, generic Java Project
2) In the new Project, create a new Module
    * Files → Project Structure → Project Settings → Modules
    * "+" → New Module → Web Services Client
    * Version → Apache Axis
    * Libraries → Download
    * Generate Sample Client Code → Checked
    * Click "Next"
    * Enter a Module Name and click "Finish"
    * Click "OK"
    * When the Soap Configuration window pops up, click "Cancel"
3) In the new Module under the source directory "src", right click and select "Create a new Package" → Name the Package
4) Right Click the new package and click "Create Web Service Client" and enter the following fields:
    * Name
    * URL (may need to press ENTER for the form to recognize the new address and enable "OK")
    * Username
    * Password
    * Output Mode → Client
    * Type Mapping Version → 1.1
    * Allow Extentions → Checked
    * Generate Test Case
    * Generate Classes for Schema Group
    * Generate Unreferenced Elements
    * Support wrapped document/literal style → Checked
    * Press OK
5) Must update the SoapEval class for GetValue and SetValue routines (which are defined by the WSDL) - See SoapEval class
6) Generate a "Hello, world" application to test
7) TODO: Be able to use this outside the existing module (create a JAR)

The following 7 files are autogenerated using these settings:
* Eval.wsdl
* Eval_PortType
* EvalService
* EvalServiceLocator
* EvalSoapBindingStub
* GQLNode
* SoapEval (later edited)
